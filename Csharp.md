# C#

To develop this project I used C# 9.0.


```
$ dotnet build
$ dotnet run [<path to simple text file representing a matrix>]
```

If it's not in a standard location you'll have to supply the path(s) to the RMatrix and Rashunal libraries. On Linux add them to `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, on Mac to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, and on Windows to `PATH`.
