Family of projects demonstrating how to call native code from other languages. Each subfolder represents a complete project that can build and run an executable. The native dependencies need to be installed separately. See:

- [Rashunal](https://github.com/proftodd/rashunal)
- [RMatrix](https://github.com/proftodd/rmatrix)

Each demonstration is in a separate folder and separate project. The ones I've done are:
- [JNI](JNI.md) (Java and Gradle)
- [FFM](FFM.md) (Java and Gradle)
- [C#](Csharp.md)
